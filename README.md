## Description  
This project was developed entirely using a mobile phone. While the UI/UX might not be as polished as applications built on a desktop. I apologize for any language mistakes.

### Purpose  
This app serves as a learning project for MERN technologies, including:  
- React , Zustand  
- MongoDB , Mongoose  
- Express  , JWT
- Advanced authentication & authorization methods  

### Note  
This app prioritizes mobile compatibility because it was coded entirely on a mobile device.
